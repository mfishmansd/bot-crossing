/**
 * Harness adapter: Cursor (`cursor-agent`).
 *
 * Cursor keeps two completely different stores and this adapter reads one of them.
 *
 *   - **`cursor-agent`**, the CLI, appends a plain JSONL transcript per thread. That is what
 *     is read here, and it is the same shape of problem the Claude Code adapter already
 *     solves for its own CLI half: a directory named after the working directory, a file
 *     named after the session, and nothing else.
 *   - **The IDE's chats** live in `state.vscdb`, a SQLite database the editor holds open and
 *     which runs to tens of gigabytes on a well-used machine. Reading somebody's live
 *     database to draw a picture is not a trade this project makes, so those threads are
 *     not drawn. If Cursor ever writes them out as files, they land here for free.
 *
 * What a Cursor transcript does *not* have is as load-bearing as what it does:
 *
 *   | Missing            | What this adapter does instead                                 |
 *   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
 *   | any timestamp      | the file's own mtime and birthtime                             |
 *   | a title            | the first user prompt, unwrapped from `<user_query>`           |
 *   | focus history      | `unread` is genuinely unknowable, so it stays `false`          |
 *   | a live-process file| `running` falls back to "written in the last few minutes"       |
 *   | an archived flag   | `setArchived` says so and the colony records it on its own side |
 *
 * That list is the honest cost of the adapter, not a to-do: three of the five are the same
 * concessions `claude-code.mjs` already makes for threads started from a terminal.
